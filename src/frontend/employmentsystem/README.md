# React Project Starter

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Yarn is optional but recommended)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   ```
3. Install dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

## Running the Development Server
To start the development server and run the React application locally:
```bash
npm start
```
or with Yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```
This command will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. By default, the development server runs at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Building for Production
To build the React application for production deployment:
```bash
npm run build
```
or with Yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```
This command will generate a production-ready build of your application in the `build` directory.

## Additional Scripts
In addition to `start` and `build`, you can use the following npm scripts:
- `npm test`: Run tests using your test runner (e.g., Jest).
- `npm eject`: Eject from create-react-app, allowing you to customize build configuration. **Note:** This is a one-way operation.
